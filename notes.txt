Order of upgrades: main files, then song info, chart fixes, pro strings, keys

First batch of upgrades: "Creep", "Free Fallin'", "Tom Sawyer (original version)",
maybe other Rush songs

Still to do:

"Creep"
 * fix difficulty tiers for keys / pro keys
 * left-hand animations; separate low notes out of right-hand animations
"Free Fallin'"
 * fix difficulty tiers for keys / pro keys
"Tom Sawyer (Original Version)"
 * fix difficulty tiers for keys / pro keys
 * left-hand animations; separate low notes out of right-hand animations
 * ensure vocal tonic is correct


triple-check all DTA's!!
